# Tasks: Redevelopment Local Setup and Terrain Vertical Slice

## 1. OpenSpec
- [x] Create proposal for redevelopment/local setup + terrain vertical slice planning.
- [x] Define documentation requirements in specs.

## 2. Repository and Local Setup Documentation
- [x] Document repository acquisition and sync flow (`fetch`, `merge --ff-only`, submodules).
- [x] Document Unity version and pre-launch local cleanup checks.
- [x] Document minimal verification steps for redevelopment restart.

## 3. Terrain Algorithm Documentation
- [x] Summarize HeightMap generation algorithm from current implementation.
- [x] Summarize DualGrid topology/relaxation/extrusion pipeline from current implementation.
- [x] Capture current technical constraints and improvement candidates.

## 4. Vertical Slice Roadmap
- [x] Define milestones from baseline to demo-ready slice.
- [x] Define quality metrics (visual, determinism, performance, usability).
- [x] Define entry/exit criteria and artifact list for each milestone.

## 5. Validation
- [x] Run available local verification command(s). (`git fetch`, `git merge --ff-only`, `git status`; `dotnet` unavailable in this environment)
- [x] Confirm changed docs are linked from existing doc index files.

## 6. Execution Package
- [x] Add execution runbook for terrain vertical slice delivery.
- [x] Add actionable task cards (`TASK_031`, `TASK_032`) aligned to roadmap milestones.
- [x] Add report templates for reproducible evidence capture.
- [x] Create implementation handoff ticket (`TASK_033`) and Worker prompt.
