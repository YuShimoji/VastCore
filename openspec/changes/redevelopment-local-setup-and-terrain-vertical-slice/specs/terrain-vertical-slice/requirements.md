# Spec: Terrain Algorithm and Vertical Slice Planning

## Requirement 1: Current Algorithm Documentation
The project documentation SHALL describe current HeightMap and DualGrid algorithms based on implemented code paths.

### Scenario: Engineer evaluates terrain stack
- **WHEN** an engineer reviews terrain generation capabilities
- **THEN** they can identify relevant classes/methods and understand generation flow, inputs, and known constraints.

## Requirement 2: Vertical Slice Execution Roadmap
The project documentation SHALL define a phased vertical slice roadmap for validating terrain generation effects.

### Scenario: Team plans implementation sprint
- **WHEN** planning a terrain-focused sprint
- **THEN** the team can use phase-based milestones with measurable quality gates and done criteria
- **AND** produce artifacts suitable for handoff/review.

## Requirement 3: Milestone-to-Task Mapping
The project documentation SHALL map roadmap milestones to executable task cards that can be worked in sequence.

### Scenario: Engineer starts work immediately
- **WHEN** an engineer picks up the vertical slice effort
- **THEN** they can start from explicit task cards with objective, DoD, and constraints
- **AND** they can move forward without re-deriving roadmap intent.
