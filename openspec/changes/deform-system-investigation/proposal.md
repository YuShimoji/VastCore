# Deform System Integration Proposal

## Overview
Integrate the Deform package (v1.2.2) into VastCore for advanced mesh deformation capabilities. This will enable runtime terrain modification, dynamic landscape changes, and enhanced visual fidelity.

## Goals
- Add runtime mesh deformation to terrain system
- Improve terrain visual quality with deformation effects
- Maintain performance with Burst compilation
- Ensure compatibility with existing terrain generation pipeline

## Requirements
- Unity 2018.3+ compatibility (current: 6000.3.0b2 ✅)
- Burst 1.4.8+ (current: 1.8.24 ✅)
- Mathematics 1.2.6+ (current: 1.3.1 ✅)
- URP rendering pipeline compatibility

## Scope
- Deformable component integration
- Terrain deformation API
- Performance optimization
- UI controls for deformation parameters

## Acceptance Criteria
- Deform package successfully imports without conflicts
- Basic deformation effects work in Unity editor
- Performance impact within acceptable limits (<5% frame time increase)
- Documentation updated with deformation usage

## Risks
- Potential conflicts with existing terrain systems
- Performance overhead from deformation calculations
- Learning curve for Deform API usage

## Timeline
- Investigation: 1-2 days
- Integration: 2-3 days
- Testing: 1 day
- Documentation: 0.5 day
