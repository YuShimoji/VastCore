# User Request Ledger

ユーザーの継続要望・差分要求・backlog delta を保持する台帳。

## Currently Active Requests

- Project-local Agent instruction files should start from a fresh, modern state.
- Align VastCore's AI instruction structure with newer projects such as
  NLMYTGen: thin adapters, repo-local rules front-door, runtime state as current
  truth, and no operational history inside `AGENTS.md`.
- Treat missing referenced docs as stale references, not blockers.
- For residual work, report purpose, effect, requirements, current state, owner,
  and next move.

## Standing Reporting Preferences

- Use Japanese for normal project reports.
- Keep responses concise and repo-grounded.
- Report observable files, commands, checks, and unresolved items when the user
  asks for strict scope.
- Do not ask the user to re-explain context that the repo already stores.

## Backlog Delta

- If a future task needs richer feature status, add or update the narrow owning
  registry/spec instead of expanding `AGENTS.md`.
- If local tool startup friction recurs, keep local machine settings out of
  tracked repo files unless the setting is intentionally shared.

## Operating Rule

Record durable user corrections here when they affect future work. Do not store
one-off status, temporary plans, or completed command logs.
