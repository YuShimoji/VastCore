# Project Context

Durable decision log and handoff history live here going forward.

Current state remains in `docs/runtime-state.md`. Operating rules remain in
`docs/REPO_LOCAL_RULES.md`. Historical handoffs and reports remain useful
evidence, but they are not current acceptance unless re-verified.

## Decision Log

- 2026-06-15: Agent instruction authority moved to the modern front-door pattern:
  `AGENTS.md` -> `docs/REPO_LOCAL_RULES.md` -> `docs/runtime-state.md`.
  `CLAUDE.md` is project context, not operational SSOT.
- 2026-06-15: M0 architecture context was captured as evidence docs under
  `docs/architecture/`. These docs record current compile and dependency risks;
  they do not approve a broad refactor or claim Unity acceptance.

## Handoff Notes

- Future handoffs should reference the active artifact and bottleneck from
  `docs/runtime-state.md`.
- Remote sync for this block should include the instruction modernization, M0
  architecture docs, and the current trust boundary that Unity compile/runtime
  behavior still needs re-check.
